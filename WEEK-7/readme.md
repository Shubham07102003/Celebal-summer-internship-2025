# ModelVista

**An Interactive ML Model Deployment Platform**  
*Celebal Internship Assignment Submission ‚Äì July 2025*

---

## üöÄ Overview

**ModelVista** is a next-generation Streamlit application crafted for hands-on machine learning model deployment, data insight, and interpretation. Specifically built for my internship objective, it enables users to:

- Explore and visualize a variety of real-world datasets
- Train, tune, and evaluate diverse machine learning models
- Perform predictions (single or batch) directly and interactively in the browser
- Understand model outcomes with confidence visuals, feature rankings, and clear explanations

---

## üìù Assignment Statement

> **Deploying Machine Learning Models with Streamlit**  
> Develop a web application using Streamlit to deploy a trained machine learning model. The app should allow users to input data, receive predictions, and understand model outputs through visualizations. This task will help you learn how to make your models accessible and interactive.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ModelVista.git
    cd ModelVista
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the app**
    ```
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
4. **Open the suggested local URL and interact with the app!**

---

## üí° Customization

- **Add new datasets:** Place your CSV inside the `Dataset/` folder and update paths in the main code.
- **Refresh the theme:** Adjust appearance using `.streamlit/config.toml` (colors, branding, font).
- **Expand model options:** Add/expose new ML algorithms in `streamlit_app.py` as needed.

## üß† Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

ModelVista leverages several foundational supervised learning algorithms, each tailored to solve problems where the "correct answer" is already known for training data:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**  
  Predicts the class of a new data point by looking at the closest data points (neighbors) in the training set.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**  
  Finds the optimal boundary (hyperplane) that separates classes with the greatest possible margin.

- **Naive Bayes Classifiers:**  
  A family of probabilistic algorithms based on Bayes‚Äô Theorem, assuming feature independence, often used for text and categorical classification.

- **Decision Tree:**  
  Constructs a tree structure that asks a series

## üìö Datasets

Multiple datasets support a wide range of demonstrations, including but not limited to:

- **Iris:**  
  A frequently-used multivariate dataset for classification, with three flower species.
